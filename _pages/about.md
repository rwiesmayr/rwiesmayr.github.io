I am currently a doctoral student with the [Integrated Information Processing (IIP) Group](https://iip.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, both with high distinction, in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Throughout my studies, I was on exchange at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) and did my master thesis at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), IL, USA. I was the recipient of scholarships from the [Max Weber-Program](https://www.elitenetzwerk.bayern.de/start/foerderangebote/max-weber-programm), as well as from the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/).

My research focuses on signal processing and machine learning (ML) methods for wireless communication systems. After demonstrating performance gains for ML-assisted multi-antenna receivers in [NVIDIA&reg; Sionna](https://github.com/nvlabs/sionna), I am currently implementing an [ML-assisted real-world 5G receiver](https://iip.ethz.ch/research/real-world-5g-system.html) on the [NVIDIA&reg; Aerial Research Cloud](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-aerial-research-cloud-for-innovations-in-5g-and-6g/). This will enable me to verify and optimize the performance and complexity of future 5G and 6G signal processing algorithms to the specifics of a real-world communication system.
